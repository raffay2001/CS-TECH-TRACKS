# CS-TECH-TRACKS
CS Tech Tracks is a platform where Computer Science students can access extensive   roadmaps of various major computer science fields for instance Frontend Development, Backend Development, Mobile Development, Data Science, Cloud Computing, DevOps and more. Students can also view blogs from different technical and non-technical topics. Students can track their progress of a particular roadmap and can also test their skills by giving quizzes after the completion of the Roadmap. They can also do hands on practice of each Roadmap by completing the guided projects. They will also be aware of the latest trends and technologies of the Computer Science World.

Below you can see the full demonstration of the project:
